I have been working in IT for several years now and have worked in many different roles, most recently working on AWS.
The purpose of this blog is to provide a landing page for my profile as well as (potentially) a repository for interesting information on cloud computing, IT, and tech in general.
Please feel free to contact me via social media if you have anything you would like to discuss.</description></item></channel></rss>
